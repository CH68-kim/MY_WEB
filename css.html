        <p><strong>CSS</strong> is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, 
           including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation
           to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens,
           or printers.</p>
           <img src="coding.jpg" width="100%">
           <p>CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based 
           markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain
           sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different
           environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content)
           from presentation.</p>
