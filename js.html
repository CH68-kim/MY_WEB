        <p>often abbreviated <strong>js</strong>, is a programming language that is one of 
            the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11]
             Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,[12]
              often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have
               a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

        </p><p style="margin-top:40px;">JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled
             language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing,
              prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
               supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
                <br>It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with
                 text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
